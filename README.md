## About Me

üë®‚Äçüéì A graduate of the [Northcoders software development bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp).

üöÄ Currently looking for a role in Software Development where I can both learn and contribute meaningfully to the company.

üíª Working on building projects to learn new technologies and enhance my current knowledge. My current focus is building a portfolio website to showcase my projects. I'm also refining and adding features to projects developed during my time at Northcoders, like [news-api](https://github.com/RGBlife/news-api) & [news-api-ui](https://github.com/RGBlife/news-api-ui) and [Reeltalk](https://github.com/RGBlife/ReelTalk) (group project).

ü§ù I'm eager to collaborate and contribute to open-source projects that positively impact people and be part of a vibrant developer community.

üéÆ Outside of coding, I'm a gaming enthusiast. Currently enjoying Baldur's Gate 3 with my wife and friends. It's an immersive game filled with great memories!
